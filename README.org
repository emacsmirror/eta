* Introduction

This is a *micro-framework* for customising key-bindings built on top of [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/blob/master/bind-key.el][bind-key]]. It provides two macros for standardising and associating intent with key-bindings: a standard version `eta/bind` and multi-dispatch version for standardisation of functionality across major modes: `eta/mode`.
